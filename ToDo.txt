Task updates since 24-10-2016
================================================================================


SPEC:
+ fix problem with zombies intersecting Obstacles:
  - you can project velocity vector on distance zombie-obstacle vector and then
    substract this projection from the zombie's velocity -> zombie should touch
    obstacle, but not go through it
  - collision info must been recorded
  - all above stuff must be done AFTER calculating ALL steering forces (or it
    will soon messed up)
- adjust steering forces weights
- there's a problem with counting score



To Do:
+ do all from the SPEC
* all files - check if encapsulation issue can be refactored
* check all comments
* check for obsolette functions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done:
- ZombiePool - constructor should generate start bunch of zombies in random positions
* remove camelCase, because it's not common in Python (PEP8)
- redesign class Vector2D
- redesign class Vector2D, v2
- add functions for adding/substracting two wectors (but not as part of Vector2D)
- ADD DEBUG DRAW MODE
+ steering behaviours:
  - seek
  - flee
  - wandern
  - obstacle avoidance
  - wall avoidance ...
  - hide ...
  * rage mode of bigger group of zombies
- detecting collisions with zombies (Zombie + Player classes)
- add collision detection with obstacles in Zombie class
- fix is_safe method in Zombie class - now it checks if zombie is within player's FOV,
  not inside big circle around player
- refactor a little Vector2D class:
  - change methods to adjust their return values


DONE SPEC:
- zombie must avoids player not only in his FOV space -> restore algorith with
  panic distance circle
+ fix zombie's behaviour related to hiding:
  - they shouldn't run to the hiding is it is behind the player, who is in front
    of zombie -> in that case zombie should Flee
- move get_hiding_position function from zrcommon to SteeringBehaviours class
+ death ray:
  - shoot with Left Mouse Button
  - length of death ray vector must be diagonal of game display
  - number of zombies wave
  - score/time (score wins)
  - zombies spawning
  - game menu
- adjust game world for drawing GUI
- fix wall_avoidance
- make some spatial partitioning for locating zombies
- there are problems with truncating death ray (possible bug in selecting space
  for searching obstacles)
- let zombies hurt player
- manage situation of player's death
- add loading-death-ray indicator
- use diffrent, more fancy font




REJECTED:
- refactor Vector2D.magn() - change it to field magn + method calculating magnitude
  when vector changes itself
+ implement zombie bot AI:
  + group behaviours ??
